# Plan

- Think about using Blueprint's colors
- fuck mobile
- Do typography customization
- Make subheadings different websites, easing loading times?
- Get KaTeX colors set up with Blueprint colors so they match
- Figure out panel/React integration
- think about how the hell we're going to lay this out in the notebook
- Have a tab for code with the visuals!
